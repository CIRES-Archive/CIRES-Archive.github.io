This Tuesday, Hui, the postdoc research fellow at CTI, hosted the first AI reading group at Swinburne University of Technology AMDC building. The participants included Ph.D. students in Swinburne and researchers from the University of Queensland. The focus of the discussion revolved around a paper about generative models titled "Interacting with Opinionated Language Models to Change Users' Views"(preprint only - Currently under peer review), the Ph.D student Lufan introduced the methodology of this paper, the implementation process, and the final findings of the paper. That is, in the process of interacting with the language model, human opinions will indeed be affected by it.

The participants engaged in lively exchanges based on the findings, sharing their personal experiences and insights about ChatGPT. ChatGPT as an AI language model has shown its powerful function. But we need to be aware that it can sometimes generate opinionated or misleading information. The participants also discussed what tasks can be performed using Chat GPT can produce reliable results., such as creative writing, language translation, and generating ideas for research projects.

Overall, the Swinburne University of Technology reading group provided an excellent platform for participants to explore AI's potential and limitations.
